# AI Challenge - Brain MRI Classification

This repository contains the code and documentation for the AI challenge hosted by:
- **Iran Annual AI Award**: [https://platform.iaaa.ai](https://platform.iaaa.ai)

The objective of this challenge is to classify brain MRI scans as normal or abnormal using artificial intelligence techniques.

## Solution Overview

Our team presents an approach to classifying brain MRI scans using **VASNet**, a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) integrated with spatial attention mechanisms. This architecture enhances feature extraction from MRI data, allowing the model to focus on relevant anatomical structures. The proposed solution aims to accurately distinguish between normal and abnormal scans, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in diagnosing neurological conditions.
